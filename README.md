Warning, ~/.vim/bundle/vim-weakpoint/WeekPointSplitter.lua is slightly buggy, and you need to pass the in-tree filenames with full path:

```
lua  ~/.vim/bundle/vim-weakpoint/WeekPointSplitter.lua  jdk25bjug.markdown -deduct -height 30 -vim
jdk25bjug.markdown exists and is file
-clean: false
-deduct: true
-height: 30
-break: --PAGE--
-vim: true
lua: ~/.vim/bundle/vim-weakpoint/WeekPointSplitter.lua:65: bad argument #1 to 'match' (string expected, got nil)
stack traceback:
	[C]: in function 'string.match'
	~/.vim/bundle/vim-weakpoint/WeekPointSplitter.lua:65: in function 'deductFileName'
	~/.vim/bundle/vim-weakpoint/WeekPointSplitter.lua:165: in main chunk

```
